# Reports security &amp; permissions

`lib/reports/report-permissions.ts:canDoReports(scope, permission)` decides
who can read or export each report.

## Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `reports.read.operations` | Production / packing / delivery / staff / inventory / purchasing-status reports |
| `reports.read.financial` | Revenue / margin / sales-by-channel / sales-by-product / catering / meal-plan financials |
| `reports.read.customer_pii` | Customer master list with email / phone visible |
| `reports.read.audit` | Audit log report (export history) |
| `reports.export` | Allowed to generate a CSV export |
| `reports.saved.manage` | Save / duplicate / pin / delete saved reports |

## Role matrix

## PII masking

`services/reports/report-service.ts` applies `maskEmail` and `maskPhone`
to customer reports and meal-plan subscription reports when the viewer
lacks `reports.read.customer_pii`. The delivery report only shows full
customer name / address to roles in `{owner, admin, manager}`.

## Formula injection

Every CSV cell goes through `csvEscapeCell` from
`lib/import-export/csv-format.ts`, which prefixes cells starting with
`=`, `+`, `-`, `@` with a single quote. This is the same code path the
legacy `/api/export` endpoint uses.

## Audit reports

The `audit_log_report` registry entry surfaces `ExportJob` rows. It
requires `reports.read.audit` (admin) and superadmin can always view.
The legacy `audit_logs` CSV export remains gated by `isSuperAdminEmail`
on `/api/export?type=audit_logs`.
